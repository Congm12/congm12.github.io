Research Interests
======
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Computational Biology Department, Carnegie Mellon University, supervised by [Carl Kingsford](http://kingsfordlab.cbd.cmu.edu/). My research interest lies developing computational methods for analyzing genomic data. My Ph.D. research involves designing combinatorial and statistical methods for detecting transcriptomic structural variants, expression quantification uncertainties, and coverage anomalies using RNA-seq data.

Education
======
PhD, Computational Biology, Carnegie Mellon University (2015 -- present)  
BS, Applied Mathematics, Zhejiang University (2011 -- 2015)
